you can enable auto-completion for kubectl commands, which is a significant time-saver and reduces typos. You can set it up to work with either the bash or zsh shells. This feature allows you to press the Tab key to automatically complete commands, flags, and even resource names.

For bash
If you are using the bash shell, you need to install the bash-completion package and then enable autocompletion for kubectl.

Install bash-completion:

Bash

sudo apt-get install bash-completion
This command installs the necessary package on Ubuntu.

Enable kubectl completion:
You need to add the completion script to your shell's configuration file so it loads every time you open a new terminal.

Bash:
echo 'source <(kubectl completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
echo 'alias k=kubectl' >>~/.bashrc
echo 'complete -F __start_kubectl k' >>~/.bashrc
The alias k=kubectl is a common shortcut that many users find helpful. The complete command enables autocompletion for this new alias.

Reload your shell:
To apply the changes without closing your terminal, run:

Bash:
source ~/.bashrc
